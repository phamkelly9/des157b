                <h1>Davis Seal</h1>
                <p>I thought that the inner ring, acknowledging the story of the 
                    Patwin people was a really important aspect that Iâ€™m glad they decided to add. 
                    I thought it was also a great choice to put in the inner ring to show how the story 
                    began with the Patwin people and that they were the original inhabitants of Davis before colonialism. 
                    I also love how the story moves along with the circle in order to acknowledge the way that events took place instead 
                    of ignoring our history and the people in it. Finally, I appreciated how many images of nature were 
                    beautifully engraved in the seal, capturing the true essence of Davis. </p>
