                <h1>Usabilty Results</h1>
                <p>One of the first pieces of feedback I got were on the colors. Chris brought up a good point
                    about the visibility of the text being a problem with the pink and off-white together. He also said that
                    the submission screen that asks you to start is unnecessary since the large plus button itself is already self
                    explanatory. Lastly, both Laura and Chris agreed on making the submission page on the same page as the upload image. 
                    This will make the process of submitting a lot shorter and less dragged out. <br> <br>

                    I've already began on one of the observations by removing the start submission page when I was working on my two versions.
                    Secondly, I've changed the color of the accent from a light pink to a dark brown, making everything more visible and also 
                    making the theme of the page more nature relatedâ€”like Sky suggested.
