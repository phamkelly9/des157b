    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <div><p>My topic will be focused on the Davis community and it will be a project for Davis
        residents. My target audience will be anyone who loves Davis and all the things in it. 
        There is no age restriction or limit for my topic. I plan to do a project like the one I 
        suggested where Davis residents could send in submissions of why they love Davis or their favorite 
        places/things about it.

        I think an area of concern might be that it's too loosely connected to the seal,
        I think. I could incorporate the seal by having their submissions separate into different sections from the 
        seal but I'm not too sure yet since if I did that idea,
        ideally, I would really want to add a digital representation of the seal but that may be too tricky.
